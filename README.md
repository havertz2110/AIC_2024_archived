even i didnt make it into the finals, i still wanted to save something for this

For large size of those 3 faiss, dict and utils, I have put them on this link for u can download https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19MsvlHXegL8jJFzzmYUqh7AthC537-La?usp=drive_link , it is about 9Gb so make sure that your disk has enough space for them :D

Moreover, there wont be json files in those dict so when u have the dataset, please re process them and then put into dict yourself, gud luck !
